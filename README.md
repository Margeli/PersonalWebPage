### Carles Margel√≠

## Introduction

Im Carles Margeli, current student of the Bachelor's Degree of Design and Development of Videogames of the UPC in Barcelona. During the course I have made some projects for the university subjects and in addition some personal work. It can be seen the process of learning and difficulty of the games made, increasing by the time. This is my library of work ordered chronollogically.
